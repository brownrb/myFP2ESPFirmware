Each board configuration uses a common template. To add a custom board, edit the 00.jsn file and designate its vaious fields are per below

{ "board":"CUSTOM","maxstepmode":32,""stepmode":1,"sda":21,"sck":22,"enpin":14,"steppin":33,"dirpin":32,"temppin":13,"hpswpin":4,"inledpin":18,"outledpin":19,"pb1pin":34,"pb2pin":35,"irpin":15,"stepsrev":-1,"fixedsmode":-1,"brdpins":[27,26,25,-1],"msdelay":4000 }

The fields are
board		Text field denoting boardname (myFP2Exxx for ESP8266 and myFP2ESP32xxx for ESP32)
maxstepmode	integer number defining maximum stepmode for the board.
stepmode	integer number specifying stepmode that board is configured for
sda		integer pin number for I2C SDA pin
sck		integer pin number for I2C SCK pin
enpin		integer pin number for Enable pin of driver board
steppin		integer pin number for Step pin of driver board
dirpin		integer pin number for Direction pin of driver board
temppin		integer pin number for Temperature Sensor pin
hpswpin		integer pin number for Home Position pin
inledpin	integer pin number for In LED
outledpin	integer pin number for Out LED
pb1pin		integer pin number for Push button In
pb2pin		integer pin number for Push button Out
irpin		integer pin number for Infra Red remote controller sensor
stepsrev	integer number for STEPSPERREVOLUTION that represents the number
			of steps for one reolution of the stepper motor
fixedsmode	integer number for stepmode where the stepmode is defined by jumpers
brdpins		Interger array of 4 pin numbers that represet input to the driver board
			[MS1/MS2/MS3 for DRV8825 and IN1/IN2/IN3/IN4 for other board types]
msdelay		unsigned long number representing delay between steps when stepping the motor


Any field set to -1 indicates the pin is unassigned (not used)

After saving the 00.jsn file, copy the file to the /src/myFP2ESP/data/boards folder. 

In focuserconfig.h set the DRVBRD to CUSTOMBRD
