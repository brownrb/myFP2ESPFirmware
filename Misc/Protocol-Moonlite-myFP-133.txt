v1.32
18th November 2017

Moonlite uses a command sequence based on :AD# where 
    : is the beginning of the command
    AD are two alphabetic chars (A-Z) representing the command
    # is the end of command teminator

+ and - and C are exceptions and are only one character commands
numeric values in receive commands and responses are in base 16

In MOONLITE, one specifies MaxStep on the SetupDialog form of the 
ASCOM driver and the driver uses that value as a check for every 
move. MaxStep is not sent to the driver.

Standard Moonlite Protocol + myFocuserPro extensions
Command Protocol, commands begin with : and end with #
:C#     67      None    is a temperature conversion, no response
:+#     43  None        Activate temperature compensation focusing
:-#     45  None         Disable temperature compensation focusing

:GB#    16967   00#     LED backlight value, always return "00"
:GC#    17223   02#     Get the temperature coefficient, hard-coded in our example 02
:GD#    17479   xx#     Get the current step delay, only values of 02, 04, 08, 10, 20
:GH#    18503   xx#     Get if the focus motor is half-stepped (FF#) otherwise return "00#"
:GI#    18759   xx#     Get motor is moving - 01 if moving, 00 otherwise
:GN#    20039   xxxx#   Get the new motor position (target) XXXX in unsigned hex
:GP#    20551   xxxx#   Get the current motor position XXXX in unsigned hex
:GT#    21575   xxxx#   Returns the current temperature where YYYY# is a four-digit signed 
                         (2’s complement) hex number. It is multiplied by 2 by the controller
:GV#    22087   10#     firmware value, always return "10"

:FG#	18246	None	Go to the new position as set by the ":SNYYYY#" command
:FQ#	20806	None	Stop a move - like a Halt

:PH# 	18512	None	home the motor to position 0
:POXX#  20304   None    Temperature calibration offset, XX is a two-digit signed hex number, 
                         in half degree increments.
                         Example 1: :PO02# offset of +1°C, Example 2: :POFB# offset of -2.5°C

:SCXX#  17235   None    Set the new temperature coefficient where XX is a two-digit, \
                        signed (2’s complement) hex number
:SDXX#	17491	xx#	    Set the new stepping delay where XX is a two-digit, unsigned hex number. 
        			    Valid values to send are 02, 04, 08, 10 and 20, which correspond to a 
        			    stepping delay of 250, 125, 63, 32 and 16 steps per second respectively
:SF#    18003	None	Set full step mode
:SH#    18515	None	Set half step mode
:SN#    20051	None	Set new target position to nnnn (requires FG to move to target)
:SPXXXX# 20563	None	set current motor position to nnnn (does not move, updates 
        			    currentpos and targetpos to nnnn)
